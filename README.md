#### `README` files can be a tetious task that often gets repetitive and becomes a chore, but what if there was a solution. Now you can `dynamically create` a `professional README` by just running a simple command in node and answering a few questions.

## Getting Started 🌱

Once you `run the index.js file` using

```
node index.js
```
You will be prompted to answer a variety of questions including your `Github username`, `Title` of the project, or even whether you want to include npm packages in your project or not.

After answering the questions, the file will be created in the Develop folder, and you will recieve a `File Created Successfully` message in the terminal.

If you want to run your own local instance, follow the installation instructions included in this document.
